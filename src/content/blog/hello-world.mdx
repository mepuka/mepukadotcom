title: Hello World
description: First post on the new site built with Astro and Effect

This is the first post on my new site. Built with [Astro](https://astro.build) for the frontend and [Effect](https://effect.website) for the backend, running on Cloudflare Pages.

## The Stack

The architecture is straightforward:

- **Astro** handles the static site generation, blog with MDX, and content collections
- **Effect** powers the backend API running at the edge
- **Cloudflare D1** provides SQLite-based persistence
- **Cloudflare Pages** deploys everything from a single GitHub repo

## Why Effect?

Effect brings structured concurrency, typed errors, and dependency injection to TypeScript. It's particularly well-suited for edge computing where you want:

- Clear service boundaries
- Type-safe error handling
- Testable, composable code

```typescript
const processUser = Effect.fn("processUser")(function* (userId: string) {
  yield* Effect.logInfo(`Processing user ${userId}`)
  const user = yield* getUser(userId)
  return yield* processData(user)
})
```

## What's Next

I'll be writing about Effect patterns, TypeScript, and building systems. Stay tuned.
