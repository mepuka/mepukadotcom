In a [previous post](/blog/skygest-effect-cloudflare), I described how I recreated [Paper Skygest](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15129) — an academic paper recommendation feed for Bluesky — using Effect and Cloudflare Workers. I've had it running for a few weeks now and collected a decent chunk of data. This post looks at what's in it.

I also built [Skygent](https://github.com/mepuka/bsky-cli), a standalone CLI for pulling Bluesky data into local SQLite stores and running queries against them. I used it to grab engagement metrics for the analysis below:

```bash
skygent query papers --sort by-engagement --limit 100 --format json --fields "@social"
```

## The data

12 days of posts (January 21 – February 3, 2026). 48,434 posts sharing academic papers from 14,381 accounts, linking to arXiv, bioRxiv, Nature, PubMed, and others.

## Where the papers come from

arXiv dominates — over half of all shared links. The top five sources cover 88% of posts.

Preprints (arXiv + bioRxiv + medRxiv) make up 61% of everything shared. High-profile journals like Nature and Science account for about 5%. Code repos (GitHub, HuggingFace) barely register.

## The 6 AM spike

Every weekday, posting volume spikes at 06:00 UTC — 727 posts on average in that single hour. By 07:00 it drops to 90.

That's when arXiv publishes new papers. 123 bot accounts, most tuned to a single arXiv category, pick them up immediately. They all fire at once, then go quiet.

## Bots vs. humans

Of the accounts that interact around paper sharing, about 77% are human, 19% are bots, and the rest are aggregators or institutions. When you look at top-engaged posts, human-shared papers get way more interaction (median 22 vs. 5).

Worth noting: this only covers high-engagement posts, so it's comparing the best of both groups, not typical output.

The interaction network has a hub-and-spoke shape — a few accounts broadcast to many passive followers. Science journalism outlets like science.org act as bridges, carrying papers from academic clusters to a wider audience.

## Top papers

Here are the 10 most-engaged papers from the collection period. Health and medicine dominated — and one curator, [@labwaggoner](https://bsky.app/profile/labwaggoner.bsky.social), shows up three times.

## AI/ML keywords

About 5% of posts mention AI or ML terms (ai, neural, llm, deep learning, transformer, gpt). General science terms (health, climate, protein) appear in about 4%. Most of the rest is generic academic language.

## Caveats

This is 12 days of data. The top-papers list is drawn from the highest-engagement posts — viral hits, not typical posting. Bot/human labels come from heuristic matching on account names and profiles.
